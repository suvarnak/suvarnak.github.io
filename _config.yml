intro: |
I am a Machine Learning Engineer, currently pursuing PhD in few shot learning from university of Pune. I have done few PoC in computer vision and deep learning(object detection) as contracting work. You may find few demo videos at https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IP6VqfMrGEzwmhPgca0WNvCV2LkTmrQI. I am good at reading research papers and replicating and customizing the SOTA research work. I have some experience of running ML experiments on AWS, Google Colab and MS Azure.
